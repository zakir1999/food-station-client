              1.3 metric gigatons of edible food is wasted every year and at least
              795 million people are undernourished worldwide. More than a third
              of all the food thatâ€™s produced on our planet never reaches a table.

              Food donation is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps to
              alleviate hunger and malnutrition in communities facing food
              insecurity, providing essential nourishment to those in need.
              Secondly, food donation reduces food waste by redirecting surplus
              edible food from being discarded to serving those who require it.
              This contributes to environmental sustainability by minimizing
              methane emissions from decomposing food in landfills. Additionally,
              food donation fosters a sense of community by encouraging
              individuals and businesses to support each other and address
              societal issues collectively. Overall, food donation is vital for
              addressing hunger, reducing waste, and building stronger, more
              resilient communities.
